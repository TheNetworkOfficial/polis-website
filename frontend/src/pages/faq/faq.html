          <summary>How do reporting and moderation work?</summary>
          <p>
            Users can report content in-app and can block/mute users. Moderation
            actions may include content restriction and account enforcement
            where needed.

          <summary>Are paid events currently supported?</summary>
          <p>
            Free event signup is live. Paid event processing is currently a
            coming soon path and should not be interpreted as active checkout
            support.

        <details class="card">
          <summary>How do I delete my account?</summary>
          <p>
            You can start deletion from in-app settings or use the web
            <a href="delete-account.html">Delete Account</a> page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deletion is irreversible once executed. If a request is pending,
            access may be restricted during processing.
