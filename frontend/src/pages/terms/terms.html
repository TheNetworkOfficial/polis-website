        <h2>1. Acceptance and eligibility</h2>

          jurisdiction).
        </p>

        <h2>2. Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>
          You may not use Polis to post or distribute content that is unlawful,
          abusive, fraudulent, or harmful.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No harassment, threats, hate, doxxing, or illegal activity.</li>
          <li>No attempts to exploit or endanger minors.</li>
          <li>No attempts to bypass moderation or security controls.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. User content and licenses</h2>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of content you submit. You grant Polis a license
          to host, process, display, and distribute that content in order to
          operate the service and enforce platform rules.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Moderation and enforcement</h2>
        <p>
          Polis may review reports and take action such as reduced visibility,
          content removal, account restrictions, suspension, or termination to
          protect users and platform integrity.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Account controls and deletion</h2>
        <p>
          Users can request account deletion through in-app controls and web
          resources. Deletion can be irreversible once executed.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Disclaimers and limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          Polis is provided on an "as available" basis. To the extent permitted
          by law, Lux Corp disclaims implied warranties and is not liable for
          indirect or consequential losses arising from use of the service.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes to terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these terms over time. Material updates will be
