            Users create accounts with email/password or Google sign-in, choose
            username/display name, optionally upload an avatar, and set home
            area by manual address selection or optional GPS.

          <h2>B. Local feed and engagement</h2>
          <p>
            Users browse local posts with image/video support, add likes,
            comments, and replies, and interact with media views that power
            engagement metrics.

          <h2>C. Create posts</h2>
          <p>
            Post creation supports media uploads, description text, and topic
            tags. Media processing/delivery uses Cloudflare services through
            backend upload flows.

            fields.

        <h2>Accuracy commitments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Polis does not claim end-to-end encryption in current public
            materials.
          </li>
          <li>
            Polis does not claim zero location collection. Location is core but
            optional in UX paths.
          </li>
          <li>
            Paid events are not marketed as live payment features until
            implemented.
